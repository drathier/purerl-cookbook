One of the handy aspects of Purerl (as opposed to a 'new' language on top of BEAM) is that tooling already exists for working with Purescript and that tooling is also compatible with Purerl with no changes.

There are some nuances that we'll document here and add to if anything else comes up.

If your editor is not listed, chances are you can get it working easily enough using a combination of `psc-ide <https://github.com/purescript/purescript/tree/master/psc-ide>`_ whatever `LSP <https://langserver.org/>`_ support that editor has, and the use of the `purescript-language-server <https://github.com/nwolverson/purescript-language-server>`_. It's certainly the best/lowest-friction place to start.
