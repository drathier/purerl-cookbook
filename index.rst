The Purerl Cookbook
###################

This is a collection of code examples/explanations of most things you might want to do in the Purerl world, all the code examples are from the `demo_ps <https://github.com/id3as/demo-ps>`_ project so having that cloned locally will help as you read through these docs.

If you feel anything is missing, please head over to Github and open an issue or pull request and we'll try and get it sorted.

I've split this giant README into several sections, some of which are going to be pretty boring to read (or just simply more boring) than others. If you're already familiar with Erlang then you'll be most interested in the more Purerl specific code examples found within. If you get stuck at all, the easiest thing to do is ask the question "how does the demo_ps project do it?" and refer to that and the documentation here that describes it.

If you're still stuck, then e-mail me at robashton@codeofrob.com, or `file an issue<https://github.com/robashton/purerl-cookbook/issues>`_ over at the GH repo for these docs.
